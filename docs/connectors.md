## Connector Maintainers

* **Official** -  Official connectors and tools are built, maintained, supported, and tested by Meltano.
* **Partner** - Partner connectors and tools are built, maintained, supported, and tested by a partner organization of Meltano, including consultancies and other vendors.
* **Community** - Community connectors and tools are built and maintained by the wider open source community.

## Connector Quality

* **Platinum** - Platinum connectors are built on the Meltano SDK and are maintained, supported, and tested by Meltano or our Partners. Additional SLAs are available for these connectors in Meltano Cloud. Contact us to learn more.
* **Gold** - Gold connectors are built on the Meltano SDK, are actively used by many Meltano Cloud and open source users, and have broad coverage of data and features.
* **Silver** - Silver connectors may be built on the Meltano SDK, but their open source and Meltano Cloud usage may be lower compared to a Gold connector.
* **Bronze** - Bronze connectors are not based on the Meltano SDK. We have some usage data for this connector in Meltano Core or Cloud.
* **No Data** - Connectors for which we have no usage data. They likely have not been tested and the repository maintainers may be unresponsive.
